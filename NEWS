1.0.2 (NanoMVC)
---------------
* Core system moved into a separate file: `NanoMVCCore.php`, introducing the new base class `nmvc_core`.
  The original `NanoMVC.php` now simply loads this new class and extends it via `class nmvc extends nmvc_core {}`.
  This allows for safer and cleaner core customization.

* Controllers are now **case-insensitive** when called from the browser.
  Controller file names must be lowercase, but the original casing used in the URL is preserved and can be accessed
  within the controller via `$this->_get_controller()` and within methods via `$this->_get_action()`.

* Autoloader: Added support for passing model parameters via the config file.

* Various minor bug fixes.

* Welcome view template has been redesigned to match the updated NanoMVC identity.

* Controller plugin:
  - Added two new methods to retrieve the original controller and action names as requested in the browser.

* PDO plugin:
  - Added **PostgreSQL** support.
  - Added support for `port` and `schema` configuration options (for PostgreSQL).
  - Rewritten `num_rows()` and `last_query()` methods.
    `last_query()` now shows the actual SQL query with substituted parameters.
  - Various small bug fixes.

* NanoMVC now has an official website and documentation:
  https://nanomvc.nipaa.fyi
