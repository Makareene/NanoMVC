1.0.4 (NanoMVC)
---------------
* Core:
  - Controllers now receive optional `$controller_name` and `$action_name` parameters in their constructors.
    Previously, these values were set later, making them unavailable inside custom constructors.
  - Error codes are now passed as the second parameter in all exceptions.
  - HTTP 410 errors now use the same view as HTTP 404 for consistency.
  - If an error code is `0` (default/undefined), it now bypasses `error_reporting` checks and will display
    when error display is enabled.

* Plugin `NanoMVC_Library_BlogMenu`:
  - `get_articles()` now accepts new two optional parameters: `?string $controller_name = null` and
    `?string $act = null` to fetch a new controller instance and its articles.
  - Added `pagination(array &$items, int $limit = 1)` method to build pagination and add a `_page`
    index to each article based on `$limit`. This method should be given the full article list.

* Plugin `NanoMVC_Library_URI`:
  - Added `parse_query_string()` method to parse a query string (e.g. `$_SERVER['QUERY_STRING']`)
    into a multidimensional array of keys and values.

* Plugin `NanoMVC_Script_Helper`:
  - Added `view()` method to render another view from within a view.
    Example: `<?php NanoMVC_Script_Helper::view('another_view', $vars) ?>`
    Parameters are the same as `display()` inside a controller.
  - Added `is_int_like()` method to check if a string is a decimal integer (with optional minus sign).

* Other improvements:
  - Enhanced error reporting in view rendering to show the reason why a view failed.
  - In system views (`error` and `notfound`), string escaping now uses `NanoMVC_Script_Helper::esc_html`
    instead of manual PHP built-in escaping.

1.0.3 (NanoMVC)
---------------
* Overhauled error handler:
  - Added support for defining a custom error handler class via the config (previously declared but unsupported).
  - Errors now use view files for display, making them customizable.
  - HTML error codes (e.g., 404, 500) are now supported with proper HTTP headers sent automatically.
  - Special view introduced for 404 errors.
  - Supported codes:
    400 => 'Bad Request'
    401 => 'Unauthorized'
    403 => 'Forbidden'
    404 => 'Not Found'
    405 => 'Method Not Allowed'
    408 => 'Request Timeout'
    410 => 'Gone'
    429 => 'Too Many Requests'
    500 => 'Internal Server Error'
    501 => 'Not Implemented'
    502 => 'Bad Gateway'
    503 => 'Service Unavailable'
    504 => 'Gateway Timeout'
  - Display of errors now respects `error_reporting()` and `ini_set('display_errors', '0')` based on severity.
  - If a controller or method is missing, a 404 code is now correctly returned.
  - Default error code is 500 if none specified.
  - Many small enhancements and refinements.

* Plugin `NanoMVC_Library_URI`:
  - Fixed and improved.
  - Added `uri()` method that returns the URI tail from a given segment as string.

* Plugin `NanoMVC_Script_Helper`:
  - Extended with `send_headers()` and `esc_html()` methods for safer header and output handling.

* Added plugin `NanoMVC_Library_BlogMenu`:
  - Enables building simple blogs using only controllers and methods with structured metadata.
  - No need for database or external storage â€” all content is stored in code.

* Other minor improvements and internal refactorings.

1.0.2 (NanoMVC)
---------------
* Core system moved into a separate file: `NanoMVCCore.php`, introducing the new base class `nmvc_core`.
  The original `NanoMVC.php` now simply loads this new class and extends it via `class nmvc extends nmvc_core {}`.
  This allows for safer and cleaner core customization.

* Controllers are now **case-insensitive** when called from the browser.
  Controller file names must be lowercase, but the original casing used in the URL is preserved and can be accessed
  within the controller via `$this->_get_controller()` and within methods via `$this->_get_action()`.

* Autoloader: Added support for passing model parameters via the config file.

* Various minor bug fixes.

* Welcome view template has been redesigned to match the updated NanoMVC identity.

* Controller plugin:
  - Added two new methods to retrieve the original controller and action names as requested in the browser.

* PDO plugin:
  - Added **PostgreSQL** support.
  - Added support for `port` and `schema` configuration options (for PostgreSQL).
  - Rewritten `num_rows()` and `last_query()` methods.
    `last_query()` now shows the actual SQL query with substituted parameters.
  - Various small bug fixes.

* NanoMVC now has an official website and documentation:
