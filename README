# NanoMVC

> A modernized, PHP 8.3+ compatible fork of [TinyMVC](https://github.com/mohrt/tinymvc-php) — minimal, fast, and extensible.

---

## 🔧 What is NanoMVC?

NanoMVC is a cleaned-up fork of the original TinyMVC framework, reworked to support PHP 8.4+ while preserving its lightweight nature and architecture.

It is **not a rewrite**, but a carefully maintained continuation with compatibility and minimalism in mind.

### Goals:
- ✅ Update deprecated PHP syntax and features
- ✅ Make the framework work flawlessly on PHP 8.3+
- ✅ Preserve the original architecture and simplicity
- ✅ Add modern enhancements without breaking backwards compatibility

## 🚀 What’s New in 1.0.2

- 🔹 Core system moved into a separate file: `NanoMVCCore.php`, introducing the new base class `nmvc_core`
- 🔹 `NanoMVC.php` now simply extends it via `class nmvc extends nmvc_core {}` — allows safe customization
- 🔹 **Case-insensitive routing**: Controller names in URLs are no longer case-sensitive
- 🔹 Access original URL casing inside controllers:
  `$this->_get_controller()` and `$this->_get_action()`
- 🔹 Autoloaded models now support parameters via config
- 🔹 Redesigned welcome view template
- 🔹 **PostgreSQL support** in the PDO plugin
  - Includes support for `port` and `schema` options
  - Improved `num_rows()` and `last_query()` methods (now includes bound parameters)
- 🔹 Minor bug fixes and cleanup

🧾 Full changelog is available in [NEWS](./NEWS)
