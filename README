# NanoMVC

> ReTinyMVC — a cleaned-up fork of TinyMVC (https://github.com/mohrt/tinymvc-php), updated for PHP 8.4+

## 🔧 What is NanoMVC?

NanoMVC is a fork of the original TinyMVC framework, rebuilt to be compatible with PHP 8.4+.
It is not a rewrite, a redesign, or a new framework.

The goal is simple:
- ✅ Fix deprecated syntax
- ✅ Start by making minimal updates to ensure compatibility with PHP 8.4+. Further optimizations may follow to align with PHP 8.4+ best practices
- ✅ Preserve the original structure and behavior
