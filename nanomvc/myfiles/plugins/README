myfiles/plugins

This folder is reserved for your shared plugins.

In a single-application installation, you may place all plugins in `myapp/plugins`,
and leave this folder unused.

In a multi-application installation, shared plugins that should be accessible
to all apps can be placed here (`myfiles/plugins`).

NanoMVC will never overwrite anything in the `myfiles` directory. You are free
to place any custom code here.

To keep this folder version-controlled without affecting your code,
only this README file is tracked by Git.

You should never touch files under the sysfiles directory.
